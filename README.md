# Gif Divider
 A C# console app to divide gifs into separate images.

 How to use:
 1. Do a git clone.
 2. Build the app, by navigating to the project folder in the terminal and using the "dotnet build" command.
 3. Use the "dotnet run" command, while passing one or two parameters to the application. The first parameter is mandatory and should be an absolyte path to the gif file. The second parameter is optional and if used will be a directory where the separate images are saved. If the second parameter is not provided, an "Images" folder will be created in the same folder where the original gif file is located.
